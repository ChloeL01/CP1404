# CP1404 - Programming 2
## Practicals Repository


Hello, my name is Chloe Laing, and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Engineering - Bachelor of IT at JCU.

This repository contains all of my practicals for CP1404 - Programming 2.

Three main lessons that I have learned about "clean code" from this subject would be:

- It improves readability for others by making the code clear and understandable
- Also improves re-readability for yourself when reading at a later time
- Using descriptive variable and function names helps to achieve this
